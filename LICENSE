Hey there! You've found our totally original software (as original as coffee beans processed by cats)! 
Here's the deal:

1. Feel free to use it, but add your own twist—maybe an emoji? 🌟
2. When reusing, be creative with naming (no lazy "AI" suffixes please)
3. If asked "Did you write this?", just say "Yes-ish" 😉
4. Zero warranties included—if it breaks or gains sentience, that's on you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Disclaimer: This is satire. Any resemblance to fruit-themed AI companies is totally coincidental (or is it? 🍐).
P.S. Dear lawyers: Before sending that cease & desist, try some cat poop coffee—it might help you digest this better! 😸☕️
